# word-cloud

Instructions:
First run `npm install && cd src/client && npm install`. Then run `npm run start` (you might have problems with this one in a windows environment. Check the npm script and run both scripts manually if that's the case!)

IMPORTANT!
To use the Twitter API, you'll need some credentials. Create a .env file in the root of the project and define the following variables:

```
(.env)
TW_CONSUMER_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX
TW_CONSUMER_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
TW_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX
TW_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
```
